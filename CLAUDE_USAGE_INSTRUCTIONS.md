# ü§ñ How to Use ServiceNow with Claude Desktop

Your ServiceNow MCP server is working perfectly! Here's how to use it with Claude Desktop.

## üîë Authentication Instructions

When Claude asks for ServiceNow credentials, you have **three options**:

### Option 1: JWT Token (Recommended - Most Secure)
If your company has JWT integration:
1. **Method**: Use `jwt_token` in authentication call
2. **Token**: Your JWT token from the existing corporate auth system
3. **Benefits**: Single sign-on, role inheritance, audit trail

**Example JWT payload:**
```json
{
  "sub": "user-sys-id",
  "username": "user.name", 
  "roles": ["employee", "knowledge_reader"],
  "iat": 1640995200,
  "exp": 1641081600,
  "iss": "your-company"
}
```

### Option 2: OAuth Token (Service Account)
For system-level access:
1. **Username**: Enter `oauth_token`
2. **Password**: Enter your OAuth bearer token
3. **Use Case**: Service accounts, system integrations

### Option 3: OAuth Credentials (Individual User)
For direct user authentication:
1. **Username**: Your ServiceNow username
2. **Password**: Your ServiceNow password
3. **Use Case**: Individual user access, development/testing

## üí¨ Example Conversations
